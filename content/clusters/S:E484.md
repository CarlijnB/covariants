- Defining mutations:
    - Has appeared multiple times independently around the world: each can be associated with different accompanying mutations
- `S:E484`
    - Associated with the 501Y.V2 variant that arose in South Africa in the winter of 2020([Tegally et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248640v1)) -- [Focal `S.E484` build filtered & zoomed to 501Y.V2](https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/S.E484?c=gt-S_484&f_clade_membership=20H/501Y.V2&label=clade:20H/501Y.V2&p=grid&r=country)
    - Associated with the 501Y.V3 variant identified originally in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, which also carries `S:N501Y` (like 501Y.V2) ([Naveca et al., Virological](https://virological.org/t/phylogenetic-relationship-of-sars-cov-2-sequences-from-amazonas-with-emerging-brazilian-variants-harboring-mutations-e484k-and-n501y-in-the-spike-protein/585), [Faria et al., Virological](https://virological.org/t/genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-manaus-preliminary-findings/586)) -- [Focal `S.E484` build filtered & zoomed to 501Y.V3](https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/S.E484?c=gt-S_484&f_clade_membership=20J/501Y.V3&label=clade:20J/501Y.V3&p=grid&r=country)
    - Also found in another variant originating in Brazil, but which does not carry `S:N501Y` ([de Vasconcelos et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248598v1.article-info)) -- [Focal `S.E484` build filtered & zoomed to 20B/S.484K](https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/S.E484?c=gt-S_484&f_clade_membership=20B/S.484K&label=clade:20B/S.484K&p=grid&r=country)
    - Mutations at S:E484 may significantly reduce convalescent serum neutralization ([Greaney et al., medRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.425021v1))
    - There has been a case of reinfection associated with `S:E484K`: a woman previously infected with a non-`S:E484K` variant of SARS-CoV-2 was later reinfected with a virus carrying the `S:E484K` mutation ([Nonaka et al., PrePrints](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202101.0132/v1))
    - In one study co-incubating SARS-CoV-2 with convalescent plasma, neutralization was completely escaped at day 73 due to an `S:E484K` mutation ([Andreano et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.424451v1))
