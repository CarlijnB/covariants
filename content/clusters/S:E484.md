- Defining mutations:
    - Has appeared multiple times independently: each can be associated with different accompanying mutations
- `S:E484`
    - Primarily associated with the 501Y.V2 variant that arose in South Africa in the winter of 2020([Tegally et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248640v1)), and a variant predominantly found in Brazil ([de Vasconcelos et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248598v1.article-info)), but has appeared independently numerous times around the world.
    - Mutations at S:E484 may significantly reduce convalescent serum neutralization ([Greaney et al., medRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.425021v1))
