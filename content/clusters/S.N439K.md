## `S:N439K`
This mutation is in the receptor binding domain (RDB), important to ACE2 binding and antibody recognition

About 2/3 of the sequences in the cluster have deletions at Spike amino-acid positions 69/70 ([Nextstrain build with deletions in cluster highlighted](https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/S.N439K?c=gt-S_69&label=clade:S.N439K); [see `S:H69-` page](http://covariants.org/variants/S.H69-))

Clusters defined by `S:N439k' have emerged twice independently in Europe, but it exclusive to Scotland in the first wave and went extinct: [Thompson et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1)


- May increase ACE2 binding: [Thompson et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1) & [Chen - et al., JMB](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283620304563); see also [Bloom Lab ACE2 binding - website](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/).
- Confers resistance to one of the two antibodies in the Regeneron cocktail (REGN10987); see [Starr et al. bioRxiv]- (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.405472v1.full) and [Thompson et al. bioRxiv]- (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1).
- May confer resistance to antibodies: C135 ([Weisblum et al. eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61312), [Barnes et al. Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2852-1)); a panel of antibodies ([Thompson et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1)).
