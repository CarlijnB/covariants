[Table and charts of mutation distribution](cluster_tables/20A.EU1_table.md)

- Defining mutations:
    - Nonsynonymous: `S:A222V`; `ORF10:V30L`; `N:A220V` or `ORF14:L67F` (overlapping reading frame with `N`)
    - Synonymous: `T445C`, `C6286T`, `C26801G`
- `S:A222V`
    - Mutation in the non-terminal domain (NTD), which is not known to play a direct role in receptor binding or membrane fusion
    - Associated with a cluster that initially expanded in Spain and spread across Europe via holiday travel ([see Hodcroft et al preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.25.20219063v2))
