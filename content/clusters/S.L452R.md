`S:L452R` was first identified in California ([California Dept of Public Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR21-020.aspx)) and appears to have increased in frequency ([Chiu C, Twitter](https://twitter.com/cychiu98/status/1350985418628587520)). _If these links can be replaced with more formal analyses, please submit a PR doing so!_

## S:L452R
- In a study co-incubating psueotyped virus with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and monocolonal antibodies, viruses with `S:L452R` mutations escaped neutralization by monoclonal antibodies SARS2-01, SARS-02, and SARS2-32 and some convalescent sera. Additionally, this study found modest increase in infectivity as measured by soluble mACE2 ([Liu et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.372037v1))

Little else is known about this mutation. Please let me know if you have more information!
