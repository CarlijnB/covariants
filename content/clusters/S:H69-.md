- Nonsynonymous: `S:H69-` (nucleotides: `C21767-, A21768-, T21769-`)

## `S:H69-`
`S:H69-` has arisen at 3 times in 'recognised clusters': in the `S:Y453F`, `S:N439K`, and `S:N501Y` clusters ([Kemp et al. bioRxiv (21 Dec)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.14.422555v3)); and has additionally arisen multiple times outside of recognised clusters.

- May alter the recognition by antibodies, possibly impacting some antibody-therapy treatments, or immunity ([Kemp et al. - medRxiv (19 Dec)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.05.20241927v2)).
- In particular, the deletion is predicted structurally to 'tuck in' the Spike N-terminal domain ([Kemp et al. bioRxiv (21 - Dec)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.14.422555v3))
- In one study, was identified as a 'recurrent deletion region' (found multiple times in public sequences), but did not impact the 2 monoclonal antibodies tested ([McCarthey et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.19.389916v1))

Note: the protein figure shows both the 69 & 70 deletion.

**Important**: *Currently this build detects only the deletion at position 69 in spike, as due to alignment/calling differences, detecting the deletion at position 70 is less reliable. However, they seem to be highly associated.*
