[Table and charts of mutation distribution](cluster_tables/S.H69-_table.md)

- Defining mutations:
    - Nonsynonymous: `S:H69-` (nucleotides: `C21767-, A21768-, T21769-`)
- `S:H69-`
    - This deletion has arisen at 3 times in 'recognised clusters': in the `S:Y453F`, `S:N439K`, and `S:N501Y` clusters ([Kemp et al. bioRxiv (21 Dec)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.14.422555v3)); and has additionally arisen more times outside of recognised clusters.
    - May alter the recognition by antibodies, possibly impacting some antibody-therapy treatments, or immunity ([Kemp et al. medRxiv (19 Dec)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.05.20241927v2)).
    - In particular, the deletion is predicted structurally to 'tuck in' the Spike N-terminal domain ([Kemp et al. bioRxiv (21 Dec)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.14.422555v3))

Note: the protein figure shows both the 69 & 70 deletion.

**Important**: *Currently this build detects only the deletion at position 69 in spike, as due to alignment/calling differences, detecting the deletion at position 70 is less reliable.*
*However, they seem to be highly associated.*
