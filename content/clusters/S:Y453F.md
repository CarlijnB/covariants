- Defining mutations:
    - Has appeared multiple times independently: each can be associated with different accompanying mutations
- `S:Y453F`
    - Mutation is in the receptor binding domain (RDB), important to ACE2 binding and antibody recognition
    - Associated with the 'cluster 5' 'mink' variant that led to some alarm in Denmark in autumn 2020
        - This variant has the following additional spike mutations: 60/70 deletion, `I692V` and `M1229I`
    - It is has also been seen previously in mink in the Netherlands ([example Nextstrain build](https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/netherlands?c=gt-S_453&f_country=Netherlands&f_host=Mink))
    - May be a mink-specific adaptation, increasing binding to mink ACE2: ([Rodrigues et al. PloS Comp Bio](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008449) and [Welkers et al. Virus Evolution](https://academic.oup.com/ve/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ve/veaa094/6025194?searchresult=1)); and appearing multiple times ([van Dorp et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.16.384743v1))
    - May also increase ACE2 binding in humans: [Bloom Lab ACE2 binding website](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/)
    - Does confer resistance to an antibody in the Regeneron cocktail: REGN10933 ([Baum et al. Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6506/1014/tab-pdf); [Starr et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.405472v1.full))
