- Defining mutations:
    - Nonsynonymous: `S:D80Y`; `N:S186Y` or `ORF14:P33T` (overlapping reading frames), `D377Y`; `ORF1a:T945I`, `T1567I`, `Q3346K`, `V3475F`, `M3862I`; `ORF1b:P255T`; `ORF7a: R80I`
    - Synonymous:  `G4960T`, `C6070T`, `C7303T`, `C7564T`, `C10279T`, `C10525T`, `C10582T`, `C27804T` <!--Full list: C3099T, G4960T, C4965T, C6070T, C7303T, C7564T, C10279T, C10301A, C10525T, C10582T, G10688T, G11851T, C14230A, C21800T, G27632T, C27804T, C28830A, G29402T -->
    - Of full list of 18 nucleotide mutations, 15 are mutations to `T` (possibly related to APOBEC-like editing within host, see [Simmonds, bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.072330v1))
- `S:D80Y`
    - At the opposite end of the loop 'tucked in' by the 69/70 deletion (hypothetical association). See [S:H69-](#sh69-) for more detail on the impact of 69/70 deletion.
    - Found in at least 10 countries across Europe
- Little else is known about this mutation. Please let me know if you have more information!
