[Table and charts of mutation distribution](cluster_tables/S.N439K_table.md)

- Defining mutations:
    - Nonsynonymous: `S:N439K`; `ORF1a:I2501T`
    - Synonymous: `C8047T`
- `S:N439K`
    - Mutation is in the receptor binding domain (RDB), important to ACE2 binding and antibody recognition
    - About 2/3 of the sequences in the cluster have deletions at Spike amino-acid positions 69/70 ([Nextstrain build with deletions in cluster highlighted](https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/S.N439K?c=gt-S_69&label=clade:S.N439K))
    - Has emerged twice independently in Europe, but was exclusive to Scotland in the first wave and went extinct: [Thompson et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1)
    - May increase ACE2 binding: [Thompson et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1) & [Chen et al., JMB](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283620304563); see also [Bloom Lab ACE2 binding website](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/)
    - Confers resistance to one of the two antibodies in the Regeneron cocktail (REGN10987); see [Starr et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.405472v1.full) and [Thompson et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1).
    - May confer resistance to antibodies: C135 ([Weisblum et al. eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61312), [Barnes et al. Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2852-1)); a panel of antibodies ([Thompson et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1))
