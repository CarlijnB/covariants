_Note this cluster is only the European appearance of S:477N_
# `S:S477N`
- Mutation is in the receptor binding domain (RDB), important to ACE2 binding and antibody recognition
- Has arisen independently in Australia and was responsible for much of the summer 2020 outbreak ([Link to Nextstrain build](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/oceania/2020-11-16?c=gt-S_477))
- Reported to slightly increase ACE2 binding: [Chen et al. JMB](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283620304563); see also [Bloom Lab ACE2 binding website](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/)
- Reported to confer resistance to multiple antibodies: ([Gaebler et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.367391v1), [Liu et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.372037v1))
