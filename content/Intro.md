This repository is intended to provide an overview (not necessarily complete) of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that are of interest.
It should be noted that these mutations are primarily of interest due to spread in Europe: this is simply a reflection that the primary maintainer/author (Emma Hodcroft) works mostly with European data.

<!-- I support and urge others to set up similar sites for non-European clusters/mutations - I will happily link them here if you get in touch. -->

The code used to generate these tables, graphs, and the sequences related to that mutation can be found in this repository.

**The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic & research surrounding it is ongoing.**
I will make every effort to try to keep this repository up-to-date, but readers should take care to double-check that the information is the latest available. <br/>
**I welcome PR requests to this repository providing new links and information!**
The more detail you can include in a pull request (PR) the faster I'll be able to review it.
If possible, provide a PR that adds/edits the appropriate links/etc, and I can merge it faster - if you can't do that, making an [issue](https://github.com/emmahodcroft/cluster_scripts/issues) is fine, but I might be slower incorporating it.

### Index

Clusters/mutations are listed below by the location of a mutation in the spike protein (`S:`) - the letter after `:` indicates the original amino-acid, the number the position in the spike protein, and the last letter, the 'new' amino-acid.<br/>
As `S:N501` has multiple amino-acid mutations, there is no second letter.<br/>
20A.EU1 and 20A.EU2, because of their prominence, have been given 'subclade' names.
The mutation is listed in parentheses after the name.
