Click on a variant button to start exploring!

CoVariants is provides overview of SARS-CoV-2 variants and mutations of interest that are of interest. Here, you can find out what mutations define a variant, what impact they might have (with links to papers and resources), where variants are found, and see the variants in Nextstrain builds!

To look at one particular variant, use the buttons to read information, see graphs and the protein structure, and link out to focused Nextstrain builds.
To look at many variants at once, check out the [Per Variant](/per-variant) and [Per Country](/per-country) pages, where you can view a lot of data in the same place, and compare variants and countries!

The variants featured are currently slightly biased towards circulation in Europe: this is simply a reflection that the primary maintainer (Emma Hodcroft) works mostly with European data.
We hope to add more variants from other regions soon!

The code used to generate these tables, graphs, and the sequences related to that mutation can be found in [this Github repository](https://github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/).

**The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic & research surrounding it is ongoing.** Every effort is made to try to keep this repository up-to-date, but readers should take care to double-check that the information is the latest available.
