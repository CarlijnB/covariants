### How can I contribute to this work (add a paper, fix an error, or make a suggestion)?

**I welcome PR requests to this repository providing new links and information!** The more detail you can include in a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/pulls) the faster I'll be able to review it!

If possible, provide a PR that adds/edits the appropriate links/etc, and I can merge it faster - if you can't or don't know how to do that, making an [issue](https://github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/issues) is fine! (But I might be a little slower incorporating it!)

You can also use the "Propose changes to this section" links that you will often see in the top-right of sections across the website.

### I want to stay up-to-date on the topic. What you suggest?

To stay up-to-date on SARS-CoV-2 variants, you can follow Emma Hodcroft on Twitter ([@firefoxx66](https://twitter.com/firefoxx66)) - she often tweets about updates and changes to the website.

You can also check out the [CoV-Lineages Global Report](https://cov-lineages.org/global_report.html) to read more information on some of the variants.


## Questions about the Variants

### What do the names you use mean?

Variants/mutations are listed by the location of a mutation in the spike protein (`S:`). The letter after `:` indicates the original amino-acid, the number is the position of the amino-acid in the spike protein, and the last letter is the 'new' amino-acid.

For some builds, like `S:N501` and `S:E484`, there is no last letter. This is because the builds track multiple amino-acid changes.

Some variants have different names, like `20A.EU1` and `20A.EU2`. This is because of their prominence - they've been given 'clade' and 'subclade' names. A defining mutation is often listed in parentheses after the name.

### How do you choose what variants to track?

Generally, variants are added due to a few criteria:
- If they seem to account for a significant fraction of sequences in a region or a country
- If they have expanded quickly in a region or country
- If they are considered a variant of concern or interest
- If their defining mutations are considered of concern or interest

So far, the focus of this website has primarily been on variants found in Europe, but work is in motion to expand this to be more broad.
