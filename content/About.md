## What is CoVariants?

CoVariants is intended to provide an overview (not necessarily complete) of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that are of interest. It should be noted that these mutations are primarily of interest due to spread in Europe: this is simply a reflection that the primary maintainer/author (Emma Hodcroft) works mostly with European data. 
CoVariants hopes to add more variants from other regions soon!

The code used to generate these tables, graphs, and the sequences related to that mutation can be found in [this Github repository](https://github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/).

**The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic & research surrounding it is ongoing.** I will make every effort to try to keep this repository up-to-date, but readers should take care to double-check that the information is the latest available.
