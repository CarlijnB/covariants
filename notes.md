**How did Ireland control crossing border to North Ireland??**
Hard to say... can't find direct source. But seems border was not closed, but movement restrictions (2km?) may have been in place. Here are some links:
- "Because of a flaw in the Irish government's emergency legislation, people from Northern Ireland cannot be made to comply with the Republic's Covid-19 travel restrictions" [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52777526)
- "Varadkar said anyone day-tripping from Northern Ireland into the Republic is in breach of local law in Northern Ireland, and vice versa." [The Journal](https://www.thejournal.ie/travel-from-northern-ireland-5088381-Apr2020/)
- "The regulations state that the restrictions on movement apply to people "whose place of residence is located within a relevant geographical location" and that a place of residence means "a person's home"."[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-52428314)
- "Even though we’re an island, we have a land border with the United Kingdom, i.e Northern Ireland, we’re not going to close that."[The Journal](https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-covid-19-travel-restrictions-5080458-Apr2020/)

2km restrictions were in place until May? [Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/coronavirus-the-reopening-ireland-plan-in-detail-1.4242985)
