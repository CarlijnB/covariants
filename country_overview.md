# Overview of Clusters in Countries with >20 Sequences in any Cluster

Graphs show the proportion of total number of sequences, over time, that fall into defined clusters/mutation groups.

It is worth interpreting with caution:
- The last data point - this often has incomplete data and may change as more sequences come in
- Frequencies that are very 'jagged' - this often indicates low sequencing numbers and so may not be truly representative of the country
